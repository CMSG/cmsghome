Welcome to the CMSG Research Group Site
=========================================

Activities
-----------

The CMSG engages in multi-disciplinary  reasearch  to understand
the fundamental properties of Materials. To this end  we  undertake
research using computational modelling of material properties using
cutting edge tools and well established theoretical paradigms  for
 characterising material properties  from  first principles. 

We also train and equip young  upcoming researchers and bright students
that show interest and excellence in their work. Over the years we have trained
a number of students, many of whom end up in world class institutions  for 
 futher studies.
